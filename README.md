## Hi ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m @gbrlserrano
I'm a 28 years old Brazilian who is switching careers. 
I'm a tattoo artist and botanical illustrator and I'm on my way to become a front-end developer.

Iâ€™m interested in plants, cats and vegan recipesðŸŒ±

Iâ€™m currently learning Git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that will improve my knowledge and skills.
